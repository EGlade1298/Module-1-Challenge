# Title
Wealthsimple Case Study by Eric McGlade
## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?

Wealthsimple Inc.
* When was the company incorporated?

September 2014,
* Who are the founders of the company?

Michael Katchen & Rudy Adler
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Michael Katchen claims he started investing at the age of 12. As he grew older, many of his friends and colleagues would ask him for investment advice; So he would set them up with a spread sheet outlining how to build a good portfolio. His friends loved the information but would ask "can't you just manage my money for me?". That was when he got the idea to create a saving/investing platform that is simple to use and has low cost.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Wealthsimple has had a lot of success with funding, they have completed 9 rounds of funding totaling $900-million. The first seed rounds began May 15 & September 15, 2014 bringing in $1.9-million from 5 different investors. Next was series A & B which brought a total of $100-million from April 2015 to May 2017. Lastly, they have had 2 venture rounds and 2 private equity rounds with the most recent one being on May 3, 2021 raising $750-Million with investments from notable Canadian individuals such as actor Ryan Reynolds and rapper Aubrey Graham (Drake).

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The problem Wealthsimple is trying to solve is the lack of financial tools and knowledge that small investors have access to. They believe that it should be a fundamental right to have access to this technology/information regardless of age, net worth, background or education. "We want to democratize wealth by giving  the financial tools of the rich to everyone". 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Wealthsimple's intended customer is anyone who does not have access to financial advisors, educational resources or capital to access better investments. CEO Michael Katchen believes millennials could be the best suited to benefit from his company: "Millennials are missing out on opportunities to secure their financial future. A lot of young people are mistrustful of big banks and put off by the paperwork. We are combining financial expertise with smart IT to shake up the industry and modernise investment". According to the Ontario Securities Commission, 53% of Ontario millennials have no investments, 59% of those millennials that do not invest say they don't understand enough to get started. There are approximately 8 million millenials in Canada according to a 2021 Census, so that means if we apply those same metrics to Canada we see roughly 4.2 million millennials have no investments and 2.4 million could use the platform to help them get started and educated about investing. 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is 
the unfair advantage they utilise?)

Wealthsimple offers $0 fees on all trades, which for smaller investors can be very appealing since some banks are charging upwards of $10 per trade. They are also the only firm in Canada offering zero commissions on trades. Wealthsimple has an advantage over banks and smaller firms because it has less over head fees such as: less employees, no physical locations (other than HQ). Wealthsimple profits from other services it offers such as currency exchange, payment processing fees from their cash card, and fees from their robo-managed ETFs. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

Wealthsimple utilises 61 different tools and technologies to operate their business. They utilise application and data tools, Utilities, DevOps, and Business tools such as JavaScript and Java; the most popular programming language, data storage with Google Drive cloud storage, Amazon SNS for push notifications, GitHub for code review and collaboration, and Zendesk for cloud based customer service. 


## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Wealthsimple is classed in the wealth management domain. Allowing users to access different saving and investment tools.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?

One of the biggest trends in the wealth management domain is robo-advisors. Robo-advisors are automated, mathematical and algorithmic investment services that need very minimal human oversight. A main reason they are so popular is because of the low cost of entry making it available to everyday retail investors. The first robo-advisor was created in 2008 but has seen explosive growth only recently, reaching almost $1-Trillion in assets managed in 2020. 

Another massive innovation is smart phones. Being able to access wealth management tools at the point of a finger using an app or web page makes it even more accessable to users. In 2016, there were an estimated 3.6-Billion smart phone users in the world, now there are an estimated 6.6-Billion users approximately 83% of the world. With accelerating growth it is likely to hit upwards of 7-Billion users worldwide in the next few years. 

Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies are another disruptive innovation in the wealth management sector. They allow users access to participate in decentralized finance, tokenized assets and much more. Opening a new asset class that anyone in the world can participate in, unlike other traditional assets such as stocks and ETFs. There are currently 300 Million people using crypto worldwide and there are over 18,000 companies accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

In Canada, the other major companies in the wealth management domain are QuesTrade, Justwealth, Smart Money Invest, BMO, RBC, TD, VirtualWealth. Other notable wealth management firms worldwide are: UBS Global Wealth Management, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo.  


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Wealthsimple has had a massive impact on the Canadian wealth management sector. Wealthsimple is the #1 ranked robo-advisor in Canada with over $15-Billion in assets under management in 2022 and has reached 1.5-Million users since it's 2014 inception. In Canada, banking has been slow to deploy new innovations and technologies, that's why Wealthsimple has had so much success. "Wealthsimple out to disrupt the Canadian banking oligopoly as younger investors look for the latest technological solutions"- Martin Pelletier.    
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Some metrics that can be used to measure Wealthsimple's success in the industry are: total assets under management, number of clients, net profit per client, net new clients, AUM per client. In these metrics Wealthsimple is performing well. Wealthsimple has 1.5-Million users. $15-Billion in AUM. From 2020 to 2021 Wealthsimple saw a 1000% increase in user growth.    
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Relative to it's main competitor Questrade, Wealthsimple has 1.5-Million users to Questrade's 250-Thousand users. Questrade has more AUM with $25-Billion and Wealthsimple having $15-Billion.  

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

If I were to advise Wealthsimple, there would be a few products I would suggest to offer. The first: options trading for TSX or Toronto Stock Exchange stocks. Options trading is a more advanced method of trading, where you make your trade based on whether you think the price will rise or fall in a certain time period. However, due to options being an advanced method of trading, I would suggest offering it to users that pay for Wealthsimple plus. Wealthsimple plus is made for experienced and frequent traders because it offers 0% foreign exchange fees for trading US stocks. Most large wealth management firms offer options trading.

Another product I would suggest offering is advanced, or open source robo-advising. Giving experienced traders the ability to tailor their robo-advisor settings like: types of assets (Stocks, bonds, crypto, ETFs, real estate etc),  allocation percentages, citeria (such as sector, market cap, trading volume etc), portfolio rebalance period and holding periods, and short term and long term goals. Like options, offering this service to more experienced investors would be a progressive and game changing idea. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I think offering these products would help Wealthsimple gain more experienced traders on the platform. Their current model tailors to retail investors with low experience, these changes would open the door to experienced, knowlegeable investors with more money. One of their main competitors Questrade already offers their customers options trading. As for the advanced AI/robo-advisor, this would be a first in the industry and would draw a lot of attention to the company. Being able to tailor every detail of your robo-advisor would draw in more experienced investors because they can still benefit from their own personal knowledge of the industry but also take advantage of the low cost of a robo-advisor.  
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?

The open source robo-advisor would utilise technologies they already harness, such as artificial intelligence or AI and machine learning, to create algorithms and make predictions on investments and adjust accordingly. The next step would be to open the source code and allow users to users to input more of their own data or suggestions, while keeping the layout "simple". A great example of this model is Boosted.ai. Boosted.ai offers "open source" artificial intelligence software for investment managers that is user friendly (no programming knowledge necessary), cutting edge (uses finance specific machine learning algorithms), customizable (allows you to control different inputs), and transparent (allows users to get insights on the decisions or outcomes of the AI). 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies would be appropriate for the solution because they are already proven methods that are in use, all that needs to be added is transparency and insights to make them user friendly and effective.
